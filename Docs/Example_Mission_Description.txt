MOOSE Dual Coalition Zone Capture - Example Mission
===================================================

MISSION OVERVIEW:
This is a demonstration mission showcasing the MOOSE Dual Coalition Zone Capture system's 
dynamic behavior and visual feedback mechanisms.

SCENARIO:
Four strategic zones have been marked across the battlefield:
• Zone 1: Initially controlled by RED forces
• Zone 2: Initially controlled by BLUE forces  
• Zone 3 & 4: Neutral territory, awaiting capture

DEMONSTRATION FEATURES:
Ground units from both coalitions patrol the battlefield in a continuous cycle, moving between 
zones to demonstrate the system's real-time response to territorial changes. Units are configured 
in a non-combat mode to clearly showcase zone state transitions without interference from combat.

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
✓ Color-coded zone boundaries changing as units enter/exit (Red/Blue/Green/Orange)
✓ Tactical information markers updating with force compositions
✓ Smoke signals marking zone status changes
✓ Automatic messaging system announcing captures and attacks
✓ F10 radio menu commands for zone status queries
✓ Victory condition tracking as zones are captured

OBSERVING THE DEMONSTRATION:
• Use F10 Map to view zone boundaries and tactical markers
• Monitor chat messages for zone status updates
• Access F10 → Zone Control → "Get Zone Status Report" for detailed information
• Watch as zones transition between Empty → Captured → Attacked → Guarded states
• Victory condition triggers when one coalition controls all four zones

PURPOSE:
This mission serves as both a tutorial and testing environment for mission makers looking to 
implement the zone capture system in their own scenarios. It demonstrates proper configuration, 
visual feedback, and system behavior without the chaos of active combat.

MISSION MAKER NOTES:
Examine the mission file to see:
- Proper trigger zone naming conventions
- BLUEHQ and REDHQ group placement
- Script loading order in triggers
- Zone configuration in the Lua file
- Unit waypoint setup for continuous patrol demonstration

This is a reference implementation - feel free to modify, expand, or use as a template for your 
own mission designs!
